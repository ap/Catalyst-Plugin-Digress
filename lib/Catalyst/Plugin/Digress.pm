=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Digress - A cleaner, simpler, action-only $c->forward

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $c->digress( 'some/other/action' );
 $c->digress( 'action_in_same_controller' );
 $c->digress( $self->action_for( 'action_in_same_controller' ) );
 
 my %form = $c->digress( 'validate_params', {
   name  => { required => 1 },
   email => { type => 'Str' },
 } );

 $c->digress( $c->view ); # FAIL: cannot digress to components

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin gives you the useful part of the Catalyst C<forward> method without
the weirdness (or the madness).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<digress>

This is akin to C<forward>, with the following differences:

=over 2

=item * It does not catch exceptions (the most important benefit).

=item * It passes parameters like in a normal Perl method call.

=item * It does not mess with C<< $c->request->arguments >>.

=item * It preserves list vs scalar context for the call.

=item *

It does not walk the Perl call stack every time (or ever, even once)
to figure out what its own name was (or for any other purpose).

=item *

It cannot forward to components, only actions
(because donâ€™t ask how forwarding to components works).

=back

In other words, is almost identical to a straight method call:

 package MyApp::Controller::Some;
 sub other_action : Private { ... }

 package MyApp::Controller::Root;
 sub index : Path {
   my ( $c, @some_args ) = ( shift, @_ );
   # ...
   my @some_return = $c->digress( '/some/other_action', @any_old_args );
   # this is nearly identical to the following line:
   my @some_return = $c->controller( 'Some' )->other_action( $c, @any_old_args );
   # ...
 }

Except, of course, that it takes an action path instead of a plain method name,
and it maintains the Catalyst action stack for you just like C<forward> would,
which keeps various Catalyst mechanisms working, such as calling C<forward> and
friends from C<other_action> with a local action name.
